% HERE, ONLY THE DIMENSION OF SLICES IS ACTAULLY INTERPOLATED --> THIS IS
% THE ONLY RESOLUTION INFO WE CAN GET FROM THE RTstruct XYZ POINTS. 
% WE ASSUME THAT THE FUNCTION "poly2mask.m" WILL CORRECTLY CLOSE ANY 
% POLYGON IN THE IN-PLANE DIMENSION, EVEN IF WE GO FROM LOWER TO HIGHER 
% RESOLUTION (e.g. RTstruct created on PET and applied to CT)
% --> ALLOWS TO INTERPOLATE A RTstruct CREATED ON ANOTHER IMAGING VOLUME
%     WITH DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS, BUT FROM THE SAME FRAM OF REFERENCE 
%     (e.g. T1w and T2w in MR scans, PET/CT, etc.)
% --> IN THE IDEAL AND RECOMMENDED CASE, A SPECIFIC RTstruct WAS CREATED AND
%     SAVED FOR EACH IMAGING VOLUME (SAFE PRACTICE)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% --> The 'interp' should be used only if tested and verified. 'noInterp'
% is currently the default in getROI.m
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
