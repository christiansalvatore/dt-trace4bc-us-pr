% README --> This function works for points from at least 2 slices. If only
% one slice is present, the function returns a NaN.

decimKeep = 4; % We keep at most 4 decimals to find the slice spacing

if strcmp(scanType,'MRscan')
    slices = unique(round(points*10)/10); % Rounding to the nearest 0.1 mm, MRI is more problematic due to arbitrary orientations allowed for imaging volumes.
else
    slices = unique(round(points*100)/100); % Rounding to the nearest 0.01 mm 
end
